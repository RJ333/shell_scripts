connecting data: contig ID, what genes on contig, sample ID, quantification per sample, phylogeny of contig and phylogeny of bin,  metaxa with counts
pathway per sample?
quantification normalized for sequencing library sizes? check paper

how to combine results:

PROKKA: assigns e.c. numbers to location on contigs with contig ID --> creating pathways with minpath
#gives e.c. numbers and pathways for the whole coassembly

quantification: 
Kallisto counts reads to contigs samplewise
bowtie2 maps reads on contigs samplewise

taxonomy:
Metaxa2 checks contigs for rRNA-information --> taxonomy of whole coassembly


binning:
concoct puts into bins, checkm tests completeness and contamination. run metaxa or blast on contigs in bin
bind contain contig ids, search in bin folder for id with tax info?
task: generate "all-table" that includes information, which contigs "existed" in which sample by subsetting, 
OR
several tables that are merged by mapping results per sample

THEN
count organims/genes (maybe minpath before/after)
